# N-Wordle
Simple script for solving wordle. At each step, the script will give the top 5 best guesses ordered by entropy. After this, provide the script with your guess (the 5 letter word you entered) and then a code for the guess result.  For this code, 0 denotes a gray square, 1 denotes a yellow square, and 2 denotes a green square.  For N-Worlde, the script will ask for N guess results. 
The script will not terminate until the joint entropy of all your guesses is 0.
I will come back and clean up some of this code at some point.  The CLI script is admittedly not very user friendly
